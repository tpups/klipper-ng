#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.

#resolution: 1.0
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a

#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.
